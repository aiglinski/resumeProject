       <article><p>(Hypothetically what I would like to be good at in a year or two) I began with HTML and CSS like most people, but shortly after began learning javascript. Today I consider myself proficient in not only those languages, but C#, PHP, Python and R. While in my software development program I also began to study sql, java, and the .net framework. (Again… I can’t actually do these things I know but the assignment said imagine you’re about to graduate).</p></article>

       <article>
         <p>What I love most about coding is you are never done learning. I originally studied physics because it was the only subject where the answers weren't in a book where I could look them up, because they were yet to be discovered. As I began to study computer code I saw the same limitless potential, and hope to find a company that feels the same way.</p>
