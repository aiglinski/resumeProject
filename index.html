      <h3>Coding Skills</h3>
      <p>(Hypothetically what I would like to be good at in a year or two) I began with HTML and CSS like most people, but shortly after began learning javascript. Today I consider myself proficient in not only those languages, but C#, PHP, Python and R. While in my software development program I also began to study sql, java, and .net. (Again… I can’t actually do these things I know but the assignment said imagine you’re about to graduate).</p>

   <h3>Continuing to Learn</h3>
   <p>What I love most about coding is you are never done learning. I originally studied physics because it was the only subject where the answers weren't in a book where I could look them up, because they were yet to be discovered. As I began to study computer code I saw the same limitless potential, and hope to find a company that feels the same way.</p>

      <h3>Being part of a team</h3>
      <p>I grew up playing sports. I was always the player that would pass to an open teammate before taking the shot myself. I take that same mindset with me today. In the words of Harry S. Truman: </p>

   <h3>Looking for the right fit</h3>
   <p>As I end my studies in my current program I hope to find work with a company that will challenge me, allow me to grow, and encourage me to be a life long learner. <br> <br>I'm looking forward to getting in touch.</p>
